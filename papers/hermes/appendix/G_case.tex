\section{Case Study}
\label{app:more_case}
We provide six representative case study examples from RVS-Ego and RVS-Movie to demonstrate the advantages of \hermes compared to the foundation model \llava. During the understanding of streaming long videos, \hermes exhibits significantly finer-grained temporal (shown in~\cref{fig:case_temporal}) and spatial understanding~\cref{fig:case_spatial} capabilities than its corresponding foundation model. %More case studies are shown in~\cref{app:more_case}.
