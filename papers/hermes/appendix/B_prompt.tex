\section{Guidance Prompt}
\label{app:prompt}
The following two figures show the local and global guidance prompt with and without conversation history to guide the token compression, respectively. For the deep layers, since they primarily focus on frame-level global semantic information, we employ a global guidance prompt as a pseudo-query to extract attention weights of video tokens. In contrast, the middle layers lie in a transition between recency-biased attention and global semantic focus. Therefore, we adopt a hybrid guidance strategy, in which the local guidance prompt and the global guidance prompt are concatenated into a single prompt string to jointly guide the token compression.
