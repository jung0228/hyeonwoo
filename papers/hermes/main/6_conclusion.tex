\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper proposes \hermes, a training-free framework for efficient streaming video understanding. Guided by mechanistic attention analysis, we conceptualizes KV cache as a hierarchical video memory system across multiple granularities. By introducing a cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing, \hermes further enhances the understanding performance for long streaming input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \hermes delivers accurate performance under continuously growing video streams, while consistently maintaining extremely low response latency and compact GPU memory usage, making it well suited for real-world streaming deployment.
